#summary Design document for AsyncSpread client API.

http://nuclei.com/asyncspread/AsyncSpread_sm3.png

A Python client API for the Spread 4.x group messaging system.

= Architecture =

Overall, the architecture consists of several classes:
  * AsyncSpread - asynchronous connection and protocol handlers
  * SpreadProto, ServiceTypes - non-instantiated container classes for protocol specific parameters
  * SpreadMessage - base class for all messages received from a Spread daemon
  * MembershipMessage - base class for membership notification messages
  * JoinMessage, LeaveMessage, DisconnectMessage, TransitionalMessage, NetworkMessage - specific MembershipMessage variants, actually instantiated
  * DataMessage - messages sent by other Spread clients, with payload and "mesg_type" hint


AsyncSpread is a subclass of the asynchat.async_chat, which implements the wire-protocol of Spread 4.x using asynchronous event processing on a TCP socket connected to a Spread daemon.  One instance of the AsyncSpread class is one connection to a Spread network.
